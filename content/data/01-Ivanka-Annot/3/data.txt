content: One of the H&D founders, Selby Gildemacher, met artist Ivanka Annot during the month-long art camp Entre-Nous located in the experimental settlement in Frederiksoord, NL, last September. As H&D had been exploring what it means to be reliant on the systems of big corporations and how to change our dependency on these systems, Ivankaâ€™s practice has been influential to us. We were excited to meet her again to discover more about her life and work and how she combines the two in an inspiring way.

Anja: What are your most low-tech and hi-tech works?



----

Ivanka: The most low-tech is the one that I ended up making at the art camp, Entre-Nous. I used wool from this local sheep herd and felted it into a bed. I specifically used ancient Mongolian techniques to do this, techniques that were born outside of Western civilization and that are still mostly performed outside of Western civilization. Here, it's not worth it to felt your own felt bed because for 5 euros you can buy a futon mattress in a shop. 


Traditionally, the technique is to have a horse pull the wool behind her, but I did it myself. I pulled the wool behind me while walking circles around the camp. I wanted to emphasize how this kind of making is outside of the structure of Western society.


The most hi-tech work was done when I was still an art student and had just come from studying neurosciences and biology. I made really big red and green trust lights and an ICG reader from active electrodes that would read all types of brain waves. 


I made a program that filtered the alpha and beta waves, which say something about your state of mind being stressed or being relaxed. The program made the colors pop - red if you had a stressful brain response and green if you were relaxed. I collaborated with Het Noord Nederlands Orkest and a modern dance group in Groningen on this too. They would do performative art and I would ask somebody from the audience to sit in this very big dentist chair and their brain waves would be read right then and there. Their responses were translated into different colors of light. The dancers and the musician could see the responses to their performance in real time. The work created a dialog between the performers and perceivers.


My next work is a new media piece using globally crowdsourced phone video footage. So, back to modern technology. I genuinely love both high-tech and low-tech methods. They compliment each other in terms of what they can accomplish and the freedom they offer.
