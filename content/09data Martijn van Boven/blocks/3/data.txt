Circulation of Circuits [www.circulationofcircuits.net] is a research-driven initiative by Martijn van Boven [http://www.474746.org/], Noortje van Eekelen [http://www.noortjevaneekelen.nl/] and Doeke Wartena [http://doekewartena.nl/], with the support of a cross-disciplinary international group of experts. The initiative aims to develop new perspectives on the current European financial system. Reflecting on the possibility to personalize and customize currency, the group investigates the topic of money and its assigned value.


Using hardware to prototype a new digital currency, the workshop focused on the embedding of value into a physical object – the Raspberry Pi. The first part was dedicated to the idea of a smart contract and the current debates within this topic. The second part was more practical and concerned with developing different ways to upload and store value on the Raspberry Pi. 

 
** Assigning the Value through Digital Manipulation **
 
During the first part of the workshop, Martijn van Boven introduced the initiative's research on the potentiality of European financial systems to centralize. As well, he explained the distance between the value assigned at the stock market and the value of a bank note for people to use. The latter form of value in customized currencies is interesting because it does not relate to the physical properties of the signifying object. Similarly, a customized digital currency functions if users of the currency agree on the conditions of its circulation: this is called a smart contract. Wikipedia defines smart contracts as 


> ...computer protocols that facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract, or that make a contractual clause unnecessary. Smart contracts often emulate the logic of contractual clauses. Proponents of smart contracts claim that many kinds of contractual clauses may thus be made partially or fully self-executing, self-enforcing, or both. Smart contracts aim to provide security superior to traditional contract law and to reduce other transaction costs associated with contracting.[^1]
 
 
Speaking about assigned value, the documentary *Scratch* covers the subjects of digging – that is, the searching for forgotten (de-valuated) vinyl to use in your own practice, giving it a new value.[^2]


Another documentary *YAP (MICRONESIA), its incredible STONE MONEY (RAI), Pacific Ocean*, tells about different types of value in objects. Large, heavy, and stationary, these currency objects are the opposite of coins or banknotes.[^3]
 

As an exercise in creating a smart contract, Martijn asked the participants to imagine a situation in which they give their smartphone to another person. He then asked what kind of conditions would they introduce.  


The imaginary contract pinpoints the concerns of exchanging hardware containing personal content. First, there is the permission to view the content. The owner regulates which content and how much of it may be seen by others. Second, there is the choice of the method to protect the content. Is a password enough? If so, how should a password be introduced?


In another discussion, some of the participants suggested that the content should only become available at a certain location or at a certain time in order to force the hardware-currency users to meet to finish the transactions. 
 

Trust is another inescapable concern in exchanging digital files. Some workshop participants were willing to trust others to view everything on their device. This approach surfaces the question of how personal information and files on a smartphone may be *used*, rather than just viewed. Defining and limiting the ability to share files and use for impersonation of the device owner are critical concerns in a smart contract.  
 
 
** Assigning the Value through Hardware and its Physical Limitations **
 
Following up on the discussion, the workshop participants implemented some of the discussed functionalities and limitations of Raspberry Pis. 


One limitation was that the Pis only transmitted the content on pre-written conditions while the software defined the functionality of the hardware. Although the software could be re-written, the hardware carrying a contract had limitations that prevented it from being changed. For example, the encapsulation of the Pi in liquid rubber made it impossible to assign it a new functionality. 


The act of encapsulating transforms hardware into a computational currency that is also an object. How does this kind of object, with the inconsistencies between hardware and software capabilities, differ from other varieties of money? What are the relationships between these materials and their organizing systems? Bank notes and stones, round and octagonal or shapes with holes in the middle...metal, clay, stone, paper, plastic, hardware? Each are physical objects carrying an assigned value. But, how might a currency system function if value is assigned to each piece of hardware separately by the owner without an issuing authority? The workshop led to an open discussion about how decentralised and hardware-based economies may be structured considering the issues raised in building the hardware-objects as potential currency.
