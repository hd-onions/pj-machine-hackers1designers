content: Hackers & Designers has been seeking to challenge organizational concepts by asking questions such as: how can we share differently, what channels can we eliminate, what are the bare necessities?


As a result of the past year’s explorations, experiences, and challenges, James proposed to deprofessionalize Hackers & Designers. Starting as a mini-manifesto, he turned his provocative proposal into a concrete cooperative model at the beginning of 2018. The Hackers & Designers Coop is a workflow model for *collaborative organization based on fiscal democracy* and divides and distributes responsibilities among members. The H&D Coop is a hands on exploration of blockchain technologies, leveraging smart contracts as a means to automate tedious processes of administration and tiring assemblies.
The administrative overhead had been carried around as an awkward baggage for too long. With the Coop platform running on H&D’s private blockchain, H&D gets to experiment with a somewhat popularized and mystified technology in a critical way while experimenting with its own organizational structures and habits.
